    <p><h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cotoletta alla Milanese, is one of the most well known dishes of the Lombardy cuisine, and can be found everywhere in the city of Milan.
    From a Michelin-starred restaurant, to your common caf√© selling quick lunches, you are bound to find a crumbed veal cutlet in some shape or form.
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4>
    The following ingredients are for 4 people:
    <ul>
        <li>4 veal steaks, boneless</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>300g bread crumbs</li>
        <li>200g flour</li>
        <li>200g butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim away excess fat and make small nicks around the edges of the meat to prevent them from curling up as they cook.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs in a bowl, season with salt.</li>
        <li>Pass each cutlet in the flour, then in the eggs, then in the breadcrumbs, pressing with your hands to make the breadcrumbs adhere to the cutlet as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a frying pan over high heat. Fry the cutlets until golden brown, about 3 minutes each side.</li>
        <li>Transfer to paper towels to drain any excess fat. Sprinkle with salt and serve warm.</li>
