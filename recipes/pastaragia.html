    <p><h3>Description</h3>
    One of the traditional Christmas dishes of my city, Reggio Emilia, made with eggs, bread crumbs and A LOT of Parmigiano Reggiano. As soon as you start eating it, you never stop!
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4>
    The following ingredients are for 4 people:
    <ul>
        <li>150 g of grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>100 g of bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 eggs plus 1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of flour</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
        
    </ul></p>
    <p><h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients on a chopping board until you get a smooth dough. Carefully balance the Parmigiano Reggiano and bread crumbs to obtain the perfect consistency.</li>
        <li>Flour the chopping board and scrape the dough with a grater (large teeth) while shaking up the lumps to avoid them to stick to each other.</li>
        <li>Drop the Pasta Ragia in boiling meat stock, and cook at medium heat for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve in a plate and grate more Parmigiano Reggiano on top.</li>
    </ol></p>
